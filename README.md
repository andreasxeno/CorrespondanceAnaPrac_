# CorrespondanceAnaPrac_

Correspondence analysis is a data or dimension reduction tool for exploring relationships 
among categorical data or qualitative variables. It provides summarizing and visualization 
output in a two-dimension plots. Our focus here is on contingency tables constituted by frequencies.

In a typical correspondence analysis, a crosstabulation table of frequencies is 
first standardized, so that the relative frequencies across all cells sum to 1.0. 
One way to state the goal of a typical analysis is to represent the entries in the 
table of relative frequencies in terms of the distances between individual rows and/or 
columns in a low-dimensional space. This is illustrated by the examples explored in this project.  

The first example includes data from Greencare (2010) and shows the results of a survey
from the smoking habits of the employees of a fictitious company to their position within the company.

The second example includes data from Bendixen (2003) and a sample of 100 housewives were asked 
which of the 14 statements listed they associated with any of 8 breakfast foods. Its important to note
that multiple responses were allowed.
